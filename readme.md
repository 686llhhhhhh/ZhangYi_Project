# Introduction

The software is based on the optimal GBR model and allows the user to input the corresponding biochar property data and anaerobic digestion data to obtain the methane yield (MY) and maximum methane production rate (Rmax) predicted by the software. 

The researcher can also obtain the model predictions for MY and R2 for Rmax for comparative evaluation. 

Based on the software, optimal biochar properties can be obtained for a fixed anaerobic digestion condition to better guide practical experiments.
